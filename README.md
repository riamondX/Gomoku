# Gomoku

This is a so far working 95% Gomoku game. If you don't know how to play it...let's call it a "five in a row".

## Language: Java

It is built with swing. Not planning to make it Javafx anytime sooner.

## Bug:

The biggest unsolved bug is that the first-time run of the game will cause a mismatch in the image rollover. 

## Latest update:

Taking username.
